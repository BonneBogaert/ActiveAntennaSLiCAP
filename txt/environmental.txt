<h1>Environmental Factors</h1>

<p>
The antenna will be placed on the roof of EWI. This means that the antenna should be built such that it can survive and be used in this environment. 
To be more specific, this includes temperature, humidity, air pressure and flow, EMI, physical shocks and vibrations and illumination for example.
The most important factors of these are temperature and EMI, as these have the largest impact on the actual functioning of the antenna.

<p>
According to the application description, the antenna should be able to operate between $-25\,. \!. \!.+70^{\circ}$C.

Environmental specification
Characteristics of the operational environment, such as
- temperature
- humidity
- air pressure and flow
- EMI
- shock and vibration
- illumination

Found:
Temperature range -25 - 70 Â°C
This interface box is located at a short distance of the receiver.
The input of the active antenna should be protected against ESD discharge.
antenna: A whip antenna (short rod)
- the antenna rod is assumed to be placed on a supporting structure.
